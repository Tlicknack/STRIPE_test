Reminders:

1. Use modified fasta
	My terrible script called : remove_unannotated_scaffolds.R should do this. FASTAs and GFFs are hardcoded, as well as output (p*species*_mod.fa)

2. Don't forget to make those symbloic links .... you know this but just  a reminder
	BWAdir/PdGenome/pdec_mod.fa     #wherever you put the fasta
		
	fastq/PdSTRIPE_rep?_?.fq        #to fasta in same dir/

	call the config files
		scripts/
		tsr/

Notes:
1. I made a new xdoit, old xdoit is xdoit_previous (its not executable)
	This one should world for Dec as is
	Will fail at tsr

2. tsr errors were always with the final annotation step, but last run I got an error at the determineTSR step
	last run I did screw up my hardcoding of the Clean- files, which made them not linked
		this should be fixed but double check
	not sure where annotation errors come from
		tsrset=1 or tsrset="1" ??
			"1" didnt work, trying 1 now


Clean dirs: Just copy and paste... It'll be fine
*from STRIPEseq_para/

rm err
rm *.o*
rm *.e*
cd BWAdir
rm *.bam
rm *.sam
rm *.sai
rm *.bai
cd ../tsr
rm *.sam
rm *.bam
rm *.output
rm tmpheader.sam
cd ../fastq
rm *trimmed*
